      I am a passionate and self-taught Android Developer who has good experience in AOSP, Native Android Apps (Java/Kotlin), Android for Embedded, Android in IoT, and Linux Kernel. I am more inclined to open-source which leads me to contribute few open-source projects. Sometimes I work in automation, scripting, and bots for myself.
